# Simple Banking System

A basic banking system I developed as part of my learning process. Initially built in Python, and now also available in Java for further practice and comparison.

## Overview
The system includes basic banking operations.

Designed for a single user, with no need for branch or account identification. It provides a simple yet functional user experience, allowing for deposits and withdrawals.

## How to Use
**Clone the repo**

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/steyukie/simple-banking-system.git
```
Also, make sure you have the necessary environment (Python or Java JDK) set up on your machine.
